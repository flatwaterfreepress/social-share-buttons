# Flatwater Social Media Buttons
**A pretty simple, junk-free Wordpress plugin for adding social media network share buttons to the top and bottom of stories on Flatwater Free Press articles.**

***

### Details
**Byline-level share menu**: Buttons at the top of stories are housed inside a modal menu.

**Buttons**: Round buttons are displayed below the story meta data at the bottom of articles.

### Notes

**Theme-specific**: These are built to work with Flatwater's custom Wordpress theme, a child theme of Chaplin by Anders Noren. You'll see spots where we're hooking into specific Chaplin functions to output the buttons.

**Articles only**: Not yet on pages or other post types.
